import RippleDemo from "./RippleDemo";

This blog post is about creating the ripple effect found in Google's Material Design. I got my inspiration from [this tutorial on css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-recreate-the-ripple-effect-of-material-design-buttons/) by **Bret Cameron**.

After reading this blog post, you'll be able to apply the ripple effect to pretty much every element dynamically with JavaScript. It will look something like this:

<RippleDemo />
