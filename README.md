# simonmader-v2

This is a refractored and cleaned up version of [simonmader17/my-website-nextjs](https://github.com/simonmader17/my-website-nextjs) :paintbrush:

This project was my first time creating a personal website, you can look at it here: [simonmader.at](https://simonmader.at/) :eyes:

I used Next.js :technologist: and Tailwind CSS :artist: to create this website.
